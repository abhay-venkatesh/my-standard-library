My goal is to try and understand the general nature of programs. 
On the one hand, most people seem to claim that to learn programming, 
we must practice. It is simply a matter of looking at hundreds of 
programs and learning over time through repetition. There is no better way.

I want to learn the opposite. What are the generalities of programs? 
What are principles that apply to every program? How do we store 
data and manipulate it in general? What is the general ways in which 
programs flow?

One thing to think about is that at the end of the day, the computer
executes a linear sequence of instructions (in non-concurrent situations
that is). 

Therefore, every program that we write, has a linear sequence of execution.
This simplifies things a lot. Everything occurs a step at a time.
