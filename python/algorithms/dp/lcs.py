--- The Longest Common Subsequence Problem ---

Let A and B be two sequences. We define a subsequence as any multiset of
elements that are common to both sequences.

The longest common subsequence is the multisetset of elements that is the
largest possible.

A = aaaabbbbeee
B = aabbbdd
LCS = aabb

--- Dynamic Programming Solution ---

We can solve the LCS problem using dynamic programming.
