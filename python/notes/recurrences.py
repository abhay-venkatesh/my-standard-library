--- Recursion ---

Recursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself, or of its type.
The recursion typically bottoms out when it hits a base case, that is, a
terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce the next answer.

--- Recurrences ---

A recurrence relation is an equation that is recursively defined to produce
a sequence or multidimensional array of values

For instance, the Fibonacci numbers can be described by a recurrence relation:
Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2
