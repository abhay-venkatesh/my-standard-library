Let us understand the following operators well.

1. Modulo: %
Consider a number, 192481

192481 % 10 = 1
18283 % 10 = 2

So % 10 basically extracts the last digit.
$ 100 would extract the last two digits, and so on. Pretty cool

Can we generalize this further?

192481 % 2 = 1
18283 % 2 = 1

% 2 basically returns 1 if not even, 0 if even. Interesting.
This is because you can use % 2 to check if a number is even or not.

What about % 3?

192481 % 3 = ?

Hard to generalize from here on.

2. Division: /
Consider a number, 18623

18623 / 10 = 1862
18623 / 100 = 186

So division by 10 truncates digits from the back.
